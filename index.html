Our generation is facing one of the greatest challenges of our time. Never before we face something that has such a profound impact on our lives. A simple virus has caught us unprepared. Thousands of people lost their lives, millions lost their job, and millions more have to shut down their businesses. 
</p>

<p>
We are all hopeful that someday, a cure will be found and we will come back to “normal”. But chances are, this kind of crisis will have a lasting impact on our way of life. A new normal has to be invented. A new way to work, a new way to learn, a new way to produce, a new way to do business, a new way to keep our health, and finally, a new way to live.
</p>

<p>
We believe that we can come out of this time stronger than ever. We believe that we can build a new and better way to live.
</p>

<p>
It’s time to rebuild, time to reboot.
